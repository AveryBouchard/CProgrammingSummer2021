Week 6 (Structures) Program Source Files

This folder contains a set of subfolders that will provide the files needed 
to compile and build various structure examples in Week 6 using multiple
files.  It corresponds to the Function and Structures, Returning Structures from Functions, Structures Within Structures, Array of Structures containing Structures, and Run Time Example lecture notes for Week 6.   

If needed, it converted the code examples in the lecture notes to 
separate each function into its own source file and provide a Makefile to 
build the program executable.  You can also copy and paste each C
Source and C Header file into your compiler IDE and compile/build your
program that way.

The subfolders are shown below, and you should be able to follow
along with the corresponding lecture notes mentioned above in Week 6.

1) Structures (Arrays containing Structures)
2) Structures (Functions)
3) Structures (Returning)
4) Structures (Run Time)
5) Structures (within Structures)
