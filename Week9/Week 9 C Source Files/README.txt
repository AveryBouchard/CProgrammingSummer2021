Week 9 (Advanced Pointers) Program Source Files

This folder contains a set of subfolders that will provide the files needed 
to compile and build various advanced pointer examples in Week 9 using multiple
files.  It corresponds to the following lecture notes:

   - Dynamic Memory Allocation Example + Returning Pointers (Linked List), and
   - Using Pointers to Pointers with Functions, and
   - Function Pointers.

If needed, it converted the code examples in the lecture notes to 
separate each function into its own source file, create header files
as needed, and provide a Makefile to build the program executable.  

You can also copy and paste each C Source and C Header file into your 
compiler IDE and compile/build your program that way.

The subfolders are shown below, and you should be able to follow
along with the corresponding lecture notes mentioned above in Week 9.

   1) Advanced Pointers (Function Pointers)
   2) Advanced Pointers (Linked List)
   3) Advanced Pointers (Ptr to Ptr)
